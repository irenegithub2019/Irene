# PyTorch vs SurroundAI: A Comparative Analysis

## Introduction

Building a machine learning algorithm is in itself a daunting task depending upon the nature and complexity of the problem at hand, the matter becomes even more complicated when trying to choose a framework to help assist you. If you are a beginner a simple search will yeild plenty of frameworks and choosing the right one might determine whether you succeed in your endeavour or not. The purpose of this blog is to help such users compare few of those frameworks analysing their strengths and weakness to help them make an informed choice. Both the frameworks chosen for this comparison are relatively new and offers tons of features which can prove handy to the user. So without futher delay, lets analyse them! 

### PyTorch

PyTorch was released in 2016 and was built on top of another library called Torch by Soumith Chintala, who worked in Facebook AI Research. Since it's inception, PyTorch has seen contributions from more than 700 people on GitHub and is being adopted and used for deep learning by many researchers.

### Surround

SurroundAI was developed by Applied Artifcial Intelligence Institute (A2I2) based in Deakin Univesity. It is an end-to-end machine learning framework designed with the aim to become the only piece of software required to address all machine learning issues.

## How are they similar?

1. **Machine Learning Framework**

Frameworks differs from libraries in that the former provides certain level of abstraction to the users allowing them to solve complex problems in a convenient way. Both PyTorch and Surround are frameworks which can be used to by users of varied skill set and experience to implement and deploy machine learning algorithms in short period of time.
 
2. **Pythonic**

Python is the fastest-growing programming language and Kaggle survey [1] of 16000 professionals in the field of data science reported that 87% of them used Python at their work place. Having the framework adopt features similar to Python enables it to be easy to understand by professionals who are well versed with it. Both PyTorch and Surround are built using python incorporating object oriented terminologies, making it easier to adopt and learn.

3. **End-to-end solution**

Solutions to machine learning problems are often quite complex involving different stages each of which consumes lot of time and effort. Using a framework to solve only part of a problem is undesirable and might complicate it even further. The good news is Surround as well as PyTorch offer end-to-end solution from data exploration to deployment taking a lot of burden off from data scientists allowing them more time to focus on the applicability of their model and solutions.

## What seperates them?

1. **Community**

The main area of difference between the two frameworks is the presence of a vibrant community that uses PyTorch, contributes to it and provides debugging tips to fellow users. Surround being relatively new compared to PyTorch lacks this limiting its exposure and adoption.

2. **Documentation & Website**

PyTorch has a dedicated website which houses tutorials, blogs and all necessary information for anyone wishing to learn it. Such a website not only provides a boost to its presence, but allows beginners to quickly grasp the basics and get cracking with their models. The absence of such a website and similar documentation for Surroud is a big point of concern which should be addressed in the near future.

3. **Extensibility**

PyTorch community forums are abuzz with extensibility issues and many users are seen complaining about the difficulty of using other frameworks and API's with PyTorch. Surround, on the other hand, is built with flexibility and extensibility in mind and plays well with popular machine learning frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow to name a few.

# Conclusion

As you might have noticed, no framework out there is perfect. Each framework has its flaws as well as strengths and it is important to know which is which before you start to use it. After all, you don't want to find out a particular framework lacks the libraries or functionaity to do a particualr critical task after you have invested hours or even days studying and understanding it. This blogs has covered the strengths and weakness of two such blogs and I hope it might have helped you decide which one to choose.
